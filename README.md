# PCPlayground
PC Building Simulator in Unity

The goal is to make a free, extensible education tool for teaching how to build, repair, and replace PC hardware. By simulating the physical process in a 3D environment, users can familiarize themselves with the parts and processes involved.

## Topics To Cover
- **Information about parts** - what they do, how they connect, differences between similar parts
- **How to add / remove / replace parts** - step by step guide to common processes, including an automated playback mode and a "practice it yourself" mode
- **PC maintenance** - cleaning, removing dust, cable management
- **Diagnozing problems** - common hardware issues, and steps to identify them, e.g. faulty connections, startup beep codes, noisy fans
- **Formatting, partitioning, and installing an OS** - possibly out of scope for this project, but it would be good to cover the basics of installing an OS from scratch
